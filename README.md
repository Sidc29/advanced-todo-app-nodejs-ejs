# Advanced To Do List App with Custom URL Parameters

The To-Do List App is a simple and effective app that helps users manage their daily tasks. With the ability to create and delete items, users can easily keep track of their to-do list. 

One of the app's key features is the ability to create custom lists by adding a URL parameter, such as "/work," "/home," or "/school." This allows users to categorize their tasks and focus on the most important items for each category. The app is built using modern technologies, such as Node.js and Express.js, and features a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to use.
